# EcoInvest: Green Finance Optimization Platform

## Overview
The **Green Finance Optimization Platform** is an AI-powered solution designed to help financial institutions assess, prioritize, and optimize their investments based on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. By utilizing advanced AI models and diverse data sources, the platform ensures that projects with the highest sustainability impact are prioritized, while also mitigating risks and optimizing resource allocation for maximum impact.

## Problem
Financial institutions face significant challenges in effectively evaluating and prioritizing projects based on ESG impact. Without a reliable system, resources may be misallocated, and investment risks may not be adequately predicted or mitigated, leading to suboptimal sustainability outcomes. This lack of effective decision-making can result in poor environmental outcomes and loss of investor confidence.
